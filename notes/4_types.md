### Types

Rust accepts the following types:
  * Integers: `u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, u128, i128` (number of bits they take in memory)
  * Floats: `f32, f64`
  * Boolean (`bool`)
  * Characters (`char`)
  * Tuples
  * Arrays

  When you define number variables as 

  ```rust
  a = 2
  b = 3
  ```

  The default types are `i32` and `f64`.

  In the case of strings, a curiosity is that you can include emojis in the strings.
